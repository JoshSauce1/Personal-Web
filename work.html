    <h2> Day Camp </h2>
    <p> This was a position in which I held many responsibilities. I was tasked with keeping the grounds clean, as well as
    helping to make and serve food to young kids at a camp. In the later parts of the day, I would also help to set up activities
     for the kids to play and participate in.
